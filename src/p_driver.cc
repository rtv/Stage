// DOCUMENTATION ------------------------------------------------------------

/** @defgroup player libstageplugin - Stage plugin driver for Player

<b>libstageplugin</b> is a plugin for Player that allows Player
clients to access simulated robots as if they were normal Player
devices.

<p>Stage robots and sensors work like any other Player device: users
write robot controllers and sensor algorithms as `clients' to the
Player `server'. Typically, clients cannot tell the difference between
the real robot devices and their simulated Stage equivalents (unless
they try very hard). We have found that robot controllers developed as
Player clients controlling Stage robots will work with little or no
modification with the real robots and vice versa [1]. With a little
care, the same binary program can often control Stage robots and real
robots without even being recompiled [2]. Thus the Player/Stage system
allows rapid prototyping of controllers destined for real
robots. Stage can also be very useful by simulating populations of
realistic robot devices you don't happen to own [3].

@par Configuration file examples:

Creating two models in a Stage worldfile, saved as "example.world":

@verbatim
# this is a comment
# create a position model - it can drive around like a robot
position
(
  name "marvin"
  color "red"

  pose [ 1 1 0 ]

  # add a laser scanner on top of the robot
  laser() 
)

# create a position model with a gripper attached to each side
position
(
  name "gort"
  color "silver"
  pose [ 6 1 0 ]
  size [ 1 2 ]

  gripper( pose [0  1  90] )
  gripper( pose [0 -1 -90] )
)
@endverbatim


Attaching Player interfaces to the Stage models "marvin" and "gort" in a Player config (.cfg) file:

@verbatim
# Present a simulation interface on the default port (6665).
# Load the Stage plugin driver and create the world described
# in the worldfile "example.world" 
# The simulation interface MUST be created before any simulated devices 
# models can be used.
driver
(		
  name "stage"
  provides ["simulation:0"]
  plugin "libstageplugin"
  worldfile "example.world"	
)

# Present a position interface on the default port (6665), connected
# to the Stage position model "marvin", and a laser interface connected to
# the laser child of "marvin".
driver
(
  name "stage"
  provides ["position2d:0" "laser:0"]
  model "marvin"
)

# Present three interfaces on port 6666, connected to the Stage 
# position model "gort" and its two grippers.
driver
(
  name "stage"
  provides ["6666:position2d:0" "6666:gripper:0" "6666:gripper:1"]
  model "gort"
)
@endverbatim

More examples can be found in the Stage source tree, in directory
<stage-version>/worlds.

@par Player configuration file options

- worldfile \<string\>
  - where \<string\> is the filename of a Stage worldfile. Player will attempt to load the worldfile and attach interfaces to Stage models specified by the "model" keyword
- model \<string\>
  - where \<string\> is the name of a Stage position model that will be controlled by this interface. Stage will search down the tree of models starting at the named model to find a previously-unassigned device of the right type.


@par Provides

The stage plugin driver provides the following device interfaces:
