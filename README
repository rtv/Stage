** NOTES FOR USE OF CVS HEAD VERSION ***

2005.07.27: Currently Stage HEAD requires Player from the player-1-6-4
CVS branch. It does NOT work with the released Player-1.6.4 or Player
CVS HEAD. This complexity will be resolved shortly.

To get compatible versions of player and Stage from CVS use these commands:

cvs co -r player-1-6-4 player
cvs co stage

 - rtv.

** Release Notes for 1.6.3 **
 
New features:

 - polygons rendered with outlines for more crisp look.

 - added support for the Player 'map' interface.

 - added 'File/Reset' menu item that reloads as much as possible to
   the last saved state. It doesn't reload the text file yet,
   unfortunately.

 - grids now fit their models precisely, and the arbitrary background
   grid has been removed.

Major bug fixes:

 - fixed walls-have-gaps problem 


** Release Notes for 1.6.2 **

This is a bugfix release that fixes several problems with previous
versions. For example:

 - fixed invisible 'shadow' object at origin
 - builds on latest GCC
 - can set robot odometry & odometry origin properly
 - can respond to config messages from Player drivers

New features include:

 - simulation interface can move arbitrary named simulation objects
(Player CVS HEAD is needed for this)

 - visualization of odometry data (selectable in view menu)

Enjoy. 
rtv - 2005.2.8

** Release notes for 1.6.0 **

 You should read these notes carefully before running Stage. This is
the first release after a substantial rewrite: plenty has changed
under the hood, but more important for most people is that the way
Stage is configured, launched and used has changed significantly.

Help is available in several places:

+ Here. Please read this document..
+ The Player/Stage web pages at http://playerstage.sourceforge.net
  - from the web site you can access manuals, FAQ and mailing lists 
+ The Player/Stage Getting Started document, included with the Stage
distro in <stage>/docsrc/ps_getting_started.txt

* WARNINGS FOR USERS OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS*

This release of Stage is very different to previous releases. Many new
features have been added but not all the old features have yet been
implemented (e.g. grippers, pucks, position-control mode, placing
models on top of each other). This version is very usable and solves
some crucial problems with previous releases, so we decided it was
about time to make a release, even with some things missing.

Before deciding to upgrade your existing Stage installation you should
check the docs and code to see if the features you use exist in this
release. If you don't see it listed in the manual, chances are it's
not here yet. Many of the missing features will be added over time if
there is a need for them. If you miss something, you can submit a
request on the P/S SourceForge pages.

Also, the worldfile syntax has changed. You'll need to update your
syntax by hand. Stage is much more configurable than it used to be.

We recommend new users start with this release, unless they absolutely
require a feature from a previous version and can't wait for it to
show up here (or do the port themselves).

Summary of new features:

+ Access to more Player goodness: previous versions did not permit the
use of Player's meta-devices. Now you can compose your Player config
file as you wish.

+ Dynamic creation, deletion and modification of worlds, robots,
and environmental features.

+ Robot geometry: robot bodies are composed from line segments, so you
can build a robot any shape and size either by desribing the lines
yourself, or by loading an image file using the provided
bitmap-to-line-segment filter. 

+ Bitmap formats: The shape of any object, including backgrounds, can
be loaded from bitmap files in any format understood my gdkpixmap
(PNG,JPG,PPM,etc.). Example bitmaps are provided in PNG format. The
days of the fussy old PNM parser are gone.

+ World size: worlds can now be very large indeed
(UNSIGNED_LONG_MAX**2 pixels). For most purposes this is effectively
infinite. You no longer need to specify a world size in the world
file. A sparse array (hash table) is used to represent the world, so
worlds use memory proportional to the amount of stuff in 'em,
independent of their dimensions.

+ A single instance of Stage can provide multiple concurrent
simulation sessions. Stage is now a server that provides simulation
services, when requested by a client. The stage1p5 driver in Player is
a client to the Stage server. Other clients are possible; in fact
Player does not provide access to all of Stage's features (the Player
protocol doesn't currently contain any simulation control spec, though
this might be added in time), so you may want to write clients that
talk directly to Stage. Of course, Player is still the first choice of
target for your robot controller.


Summary of new internal stuff, not apparent to the user:

+ Timing and synchronization with Player works properly.

+ Stage is now written entirely in C and makes extensive use of GLib
data structures.

+ Multi-resolution ray-tracing: the cost of using a memory-friendly
hash table for the underlying world representation (matrix) is a much
greater time-cost in checking and setting matrix cells. This made
ray-tracing very slow. To compensate, I implemented multi-resolution
ray tracing, reducing the number of matrix lookups by a factor of a
few hundred in typical use. The result is faster ray-tracing
performance overall compared to previous versions.

This README provides a quick-start guide to building and running
Stage.  Consult the Stage User Manual for full details.

-- What is Stage? ---------------------------------------------------------

Stage simulates mobile robots and sensors in a two-dimensional
bitmapped environment containing a variety of objects. Stage is
designed to work well with Player. Player provides a powerful,
flexible interface to a variety of robot hardware; Stage provides
virtual devices for Player. Various sensor models are provided,
including sonar, scanning laser rangefinder, color blob tracking from
a pan-tilt-zoom camera and odometry. Several controllers designed in
Stage have been demonstrated to work on real robots.

Stage is developed by the Player/Stage Project (P/S), an international
consortium of robotics researchers. P/S is lead by Brian Gerkey
(Stanford University), Richard Vaughan (Simon Fraser University) and
Andrew Howard (University of Southern California).

-- Compiling ---------------------------------------------------------------

** NOTE FOR USERS BUILDING OUT OF CVS **

If you pulled the sources from CVS rather than using a released
package, you need to generate a 'configure' script. This script is
built automatically when we package up a release, but doesn't actually
exist in the CVS repository. To create this script, you must run
'bootstrap' instead of 'configure' on first checkout and after cvs
updating.

**

** TODO - WARNING - THIS SECTION IS OUT OF DATE **


We use the standard GNU build system: download; extract; configure;
make install. 

0) Obtain and install these packages, on which Stage depends:

- librtk2 (available from http://playerstage.sourceforge.net)

1) unpack the Stage tarball with

$ tar xzvf stage-<version>.tgz

The tar on some systems (such as OS X) does not support the '-z'
option, so you have to gunzip first, then 'tar xvf stage-<version>.tar'

2) configure stage:

Stage needs to know the path to your Player installation or build
directory, and to librtk and your X11 color database if you want to
use the GUI. We use the GNU autoconf system to handle these
configurations, plus various optional components and cross-platform
compatibility issues. If you installed Player and librtk in their
default locations (/usr/local), and you want a normal installation,
the defaults should work:

$ cd stage-<version>
$ ./configure

(or, if you're building from CVS:

$ ./bootstrap 
)

To see all the available configuration options do:

$ configure --help

3) compile stage:

$ make

will build the binary src/stage.

Optionally, as root you can do:
 
$ make install

to install the executables in /usr/local/bin/

You can specify a different installation directory using:

$ configure --prefix=<install dir>

Which is useful if you don't have root access to your machine. If you
change the prefix, remember to set the correct path to Player and
librtk.

-- Running ---------------------------------------------------------------

To test the Stage you just built do:

$ src/stage

You should see the following output:

* Stage-1.4.dev * [localhost:6600]  
* Ready.

Note that Stage doesn't do anything interesting until a client
connects and requests simulation session. Player is a suitable client.


-- Using Stage ----------------------------------------------------

You must use a client program to access Stage, just as you must use a
browser to access a web server, or a Player client to access
Player. The latest releases of Player contain the stageclient driver
that allows Player to be a Stage client. See the documentation for the
stageclient driver.

The stageclient driver uses the libStage C library that comes with
Stage. You can use this library to write your own client quite
simply. The libStage API will eventually be documented in the Stage
manual. 

-- Worldfiles ----------------------------------------------------

The Stage client library libStage can create worlds based on a text
decription called a "worldfile". This file is not loaded directly by
Stage, as was the case in previous releases. The worldfile format is
documented in the Stage manual, but you can get the idea from looking
at the examples in the <stage>/worlds directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy, and let us know what you do with Stage.
