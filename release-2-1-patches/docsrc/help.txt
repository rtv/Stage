@defgroup help Getting Help

If you're having problems and you can't find what you need in this manual, there are several places to find help. 

First, please check the <a
href=http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/doc.html>online
documentation page</a> to make sure you have the latest
documentation. In particular, check the <a
href=http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/stage_user/faq.html>latest
online latest FAQ page</a>.

Next, you should search <a
href=http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=8201>the
playerstage_users mailing list archive</a> to
see if your questions have already been answered.

Next, you should probably spend a few minutes with <a
href=http://www.google.com>Google</a>. This often works well, as it
picks up P/S conversations from all over the place.

If you still need help, you can send email to the mailing list
playerstage_users@lists.sourceforge.net and a user or developer may
reply to you. <b>Remember that these mails go to hundreds of people</b>, so
please be polite and give as much information as you can in your
email.

@defgroup install Installation

<b>Important: Stage is an extension to Player; Player must be properly
installed before you can install Stage.</b>

<h2>Quick start</h2>

Install Player first, then Stage, using the standard GNU autotools
build system: download and extract the tarballs, then <tt>./configure
; make install</tt>.

<h2>Standard install procedure</h2>

<p>To install Stage in the default location, follow these steps:

<ol>

<li>Make sure Player is installed and working. See the Player
 documentation for instructions.

<li>Download the latest Stage source tarball (stage-src-\<version\>.tgz)
from <a href=http:playerstage.sf.net>http://playerstage.sf.net</a>

<li>Uncompress and expand the tarball: <br>
    <tt>$ tar xzvf stage-\<version\>.tgz</tt>

<li>`cd' into Stage's source directory:<br>
     <tt>$ cd stage-\<version\></tt>
 
<li>To configure Stage with default settings:<br>
<tt>$ ./configure</tt><br>

<li>Compile Stage:<br>
<tt>$ make</tt>

<li>Install Stage. By default, Stage will be installed in
<tt>/usr/local</tt> so you need to become root for this step. Remember
to return to your normal user ID afterwards. <br> 
<tt>$ make install</tt>

</ol>

<h2>Customized installations</h2>

<p>Stage follows the standard GNU autotools conventions for build and
install options. To see a list of all the available configuration
options, do this:

<p><tt>./configure --help</tt>

<p>The most important option is <tt>--prefix</tt>, used
to change the installation directory from the default (which varies
from system to system, but is usually <tt>/usr/local</tt>). In
general, Stage should get the same prefix you used to install Player. Prefixes must be absolute paths, i.e. a complete path starting with a '/'.

<p>For example, you might want to install Stage your home directory
because you don't have root access:

<p><tt>$./configure --prefix=/home/harrison/PS</tt>

<p><b>Remember: these instructions assume that Player was configured with the
same prefix.</b> The command line to do this is probably the same, but you
should check the Player instructions just in case.

/**
@page release Release Notes

<h2>Version 1.6.1</h2>

This is a bug-fix release that replaces 1.6.0. 

- Fixes several GUI bugs, including the [View/Fill Polygons] menu item.

- Some code clean-up and thread-safety fixes

<h2>Version 1.6.0</h2>

This release of Stage is the first after a major rewrite. There are
bound to be bugs and teething troubles, but the <a
href=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/research/groups/autonomy>Autonomy Lab</a>
has been using this code for serious work for a few months now and we
think it's useful and usable.

<h3>Significant changes visible to the user</h3>

<ol>

<li>Stage is now a Player plugin, instead of an executable. The key
benefit of this is that <b>all Player drivers are now available for
use directly with Stage</b>, including sophisticated drivers like
AMCL, without needing passthrough drivers.

<li>Stage depends on Player 1.6 or newer.

<li>Worldfile syntax has a changed, so you need to edit your existing
worlds to get them to work. Look at the example worlds in <tt>(stage
src)/worlds</tt> to get the idea.

<li>Any object can now have its shape specified by a bitmap file

<li>Several bitmap file formats are supported, using a third-party
library. Load maps and robot bodies from JPG, PNG, etc. No more PNM
troubles.

<li>Worlds can now be very large (thousands of meters square).

<li>Several models are missing from this release - notably the gripper
and puck. These will be available soon. Meanwhile, enjoy the full
power of Player with the basic laser, sonar, position, fiducial and
blobfinder models.

<li>Stage no longer depends on libRTK.

<li>Some models from previous versions may not yet be available in
this release (e.g. gripper & puck), but we're working on them. Let us
know which ones you need.

</ol>

<h3>Significant changes under the hood</h3>

<ol>

<li>The Stage simulation engine is now a library rather than an
application. The library can be used to write custom robot
simulations. This is very useful if you need to do synchronous control
of robots (e.g for perfectly repeatable experiments), or dynamically
create and destroy robots or other objects. You can't (yet) do this
though Player. Refer to the <a
href=http://playerstage.sf.net/doc/stage_reference>libstage reference
manual</a> for the API and developer docs.</a>.

<li>Stage is now mostly written in C. A simple object-oriented system
allows one level of inheritance for writing polymorphic model code.

<li>The underlying occupancy grid model has changed from a simple
fixed-size array to a sparse array of (almost) unlimited size
(implemented with a hash table). To compensate for the performance hit
of raytracing in the hash table, a three-level multiple-resolution
approach is used. Raytracing is now usually <i>much</i> faster than in
Stage-1.3. To get an idea how this works, select the
View/Debug/Raytrace menu item while a laser or ranger is producing
data.

<li>Most home-rolled data structures have been replaced by glib
versions.

</ol>
